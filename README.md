# Timepiece

Swift extensions to access dates in an intuitive way

## Usage

### Add durations to date

```swift
let now = NSDate()
let nextWeek = now + 1.week
let dayAfterTomorrow = now + 2.days

// shortcuts #1
let today = NSDate.today()
let tomorrow = NSDate.tomorrow()
let yesterday = NSDate.yesterday()

// shortcuts #2
let dayBeforeYesterday = 2.days.ago
let tokyoOlympicYear = 5.years.later
```

### Initialize by specifying date components

```swift
let birthday = NSDate.date(year: 1987, month: 6, day: 2)
let firstCommitDate = NSDate.date(year: 2014, month: 8, day: 15, hour: 20, minute: 25, second: 43)
```

### Initialize by changing date components

```swift
let now = NSDate()
let christmas = now.change(month: 12, day: 25)
let thisSunday = now.change(weekday: 1)

// shortcuts
let newYearDay = now.beginningOfYear
let timeLimit = now.endOfHour
```
